How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

That's correct, my code, program, or software is secure and functional. It might be difficult to ensure that the code is secure and functional. I've just been experimenting with code for this class so far, and it may have required to be more equitable in some areas. The lesson showed me how complicated it is. If I follow the guidelines and run rigorous tests with a high coverage percentage, you may be certain that my code is safe and functional. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

My specialization is incorporating user requirements into software. Reading and breaking down user needs teaches me how to make them program-friendly. Length limitations and blank submissions are two examples. To begin with, names could not be empty or more than 10 characters long. Following its reading, I inserted an if statement to handle both application failures. Because it makes the requirement a success precondition, this way is the simplest for translating a requirement into a program. Sometimes the criteria are confusing and need more examination. With a click, my software from another class needs to add time to two clocks. 

How do I approach designing software?

I am in charge of developing software. I should improve my toolmaking skills. Looking through papers or interview records is how I usually make a list of requirements. If required, I compile a list of things and techniques to satisfy these requirements. I code to fulfill all criteria immediately after compiling my lists. It improves once the code is functional. This strategy could work better for me if it were larger and more comprehensive, but for now, it suffices.
